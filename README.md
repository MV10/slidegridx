# slidegridx

Linux multi-monitor / tiled slideshow program for events, parties, etc.

Work in progress. Requires OpenGL 4.5, and X11 is probably more reliable than Wayland.

Technically this code is compatible with Windows, too, but my [slidegrid](https://github.com/MV10/slidegrid) project provides a Windows GUI.
